#PESGraph

--------

##Introduction

PESGraph is a simple graph implementation for Foundation.kit that allows for creating structures
of nodes and paths, and then finding the shortest path between them.  It includes unit tests that also
provide some examples of how to use the code.

##Future Development

Next step will be to add A* to the pathfinding code.
